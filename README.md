# Auto Clicker

Auto Clicker is a useful tool to automatically click mouse instead of hand. If you click mouse frequently when you are 
playing game or working, this application can release your finger and save your time.

even lets you record sequences of clicks on different parts of the screen to be used over and over. From the Options menu, 
you can select which mouse button to use and also select single or double clicks. The application can also be set to 
continue clicking until it's stopped or to click just a certain number of times, and you can adjust the interval between 
clicks in hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds. Compatible with Windows 7, Windows 10, and 64-bit systems.
